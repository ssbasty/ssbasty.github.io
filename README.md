## Projects
- **Dextrous Slender Body Robot for Laparoscopic Applications (_February 2024 - Present_)**
  - Engineering a 3D printed bio-inspired (inspiration taken from  octopus feet üêô) silicone slender body robot with an integrated visualization & imaging element.
  - The final product intends to enable visualization, spatial manipulation & maneuverability in surgically relevant biological environments while also being biocompatible in nature.

- **Wrist rehabilitation robot using McKibben actuators controlled by EMG (_October 2023 - December 2023_) (_Group project_)**
  - Built a silicone soft robot with McKibben flexible actuator that is actuated by Electromyography (EMG) signals from forearm operating a setup consisting of AD8226-based EMG sensors, Arduino Uno, McKibben actuators, MOSFET and Solenoids. (This project developed for my medical robotics class holds immense personal significance because when I was about seven years old, I had broken my elbow joint thus losing wrist function and I had to undergo long durations of physiotherapy to regain wrist function and the ability to write. This is my effort to make the rehabilitation process streamlined and faster. üòä)
  - Upon testing the system, a flexion angle of 35.42¬∞ for wrist movement was achieved which is close to the established 38¬∞ for normal functioning.
  - A NASA task load assessment (TLX) was performed to assess ergonomic performance & ease of use of the design.
