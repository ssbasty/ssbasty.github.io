## Projects
- **Dextrous Slender Body Robot for Laparoscopic Applications (_February 2024 - Present_)**
  - Engineering a 3D printed bio-inspired (inspiration taken from  octopus feet üêô) silicone slender body robot with an integrated visualization & imaging element.
  - The final product intends to enable visualization, spatial manipulation & maneuverability in surgically relevant biological environments while also being biocompatible in nature.

- **Wrist rehabilitation robot using McKibben actuators controlled by EMG (_October 2023 - December 2023_)**
  - Built a silicone soft robot with McKibben flexible actuator that is actuated by Electromyography (EMG) signals from forearm operating a setup consisting of AD8226-based EMG sensors, Arduino Uno, McKibben actuators, MOSFET and Solenoids.
  - Upon testing the system, a flexion angle of 35.42¬∞ for wrist movement was achieved which is close to required 38¬∞ for normal functioning.
  - A NASA task load assessment (TLX) was performed to assess ergonomic performance & ease of use of the design.
